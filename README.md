# Prasanna Saravanan

### AI Systems Architect

Precision engineering. Tooling ecosystems. Agent infrastructure.  
Systems over hype. Architecture over execution.

---

## Current Work

- TractionX — Venture intelligence OS for private markets  
- Kernel.dev — Standard runtime for agent tools  
- Async Systems — Redis-backed pipelines, orchestration, distributed workers  
- Autonomous Agents — Thesis-trained models for sourcing, scoring, execution  

---

## Technical Stack

Python • FastAPI • Redis • Postgres  
Next.js • Tailwind  
OpenAI • TogetherAI • VertexAI • Qdrant

---

## Operating Principles

- Bias for deterministic systems  
- Implementation first  
- Architecture is the product
